# Dashflow - A dashboard to visualize flow data and KPIs

## First step:

1. Design a page for file uploading or just a button or a link to load the dump file
    - For the backend, find a program or library to load the excel dum file via python programming language

2. Analyse data to classify column and identify fields
    - For the frontend display those data

3. Implement formulas needed to calculate KPIs
    - Display the data to the front

> In bonus, the app will provide information based on flow variations
> It should manage the list updated of customer advisors

## In resume

This app will display a couple of web pages to display load dump files, calculate KPIs and displays data to the Flow Manager for gaining in time
